# simpleusermanagement
small exercise to get my feet wet on .NetCore

this should be an api that allow basic CRUD operations for users
additional functionality is the use of jwt token for auth

composed mainly of code snips I found on the interweb plus lots of code and files autogenerated by Visual Studio's wizards

works on my machine certified
copy on to your drive and run dotnet run on the folder with the project file and it should spin up localhost:4000

ToDo
cleanup the autogenerated code
cleanup the autogenerated files

work in progress
